"For perfect glitch free joining of 4k files, you must join them 1st before putting them on a timeline. Use the free software ""My MP4Box GUI"" and select the join tab. It will properly join the file sets together perfectly with no audio or video glitches. Just make sure that you choose the proper video files that go together on a ""per recording"" basis. I put my USA NTSC G7 in service mode and get unlimited 4k recording time. It is just a killer camera for the price. I also like that it has the low pass filter on the sensor to help with moire. I have a GX85 and it can have just a slightly sharper image (barely if at all) but it definitely can suffer from moire that the G7 controls better.",0.9032

"We got the Panasonic G7 with the 14-140mm lens for vlogging and travel videos. It's a fantastic camera for the price. The lens was a good choice because of the range you have. I got some awesome shots of boats from being on a ferry and I would have never got them if I chose a different lens. We just posted our first ever vlog if anyone wants to see a more ""real world"" use for the camera. The autofocus was hit and miss though as I only purchased the camera before we left and I hadn't nailed the settings yet.",0.875
"The AF Continuous setting works the same as previous Panasonic cameras: it enables AF to be continually adjusting while shooting video. Otherwise you need to tap of half-press to refocus during video. Best to keep this OFF to avoid focus hunting during video but you MUST pay attention to focus and refocus if the subject depth changes either manually using the focus ring on the lens or automatically by tapping or half-pressing or however you have set up the camera to focus. For handing the camera to a n00b you put Continuous AF to ON: it'll focus hunt during video, but at least it'll refocus instead of having a whole video out of focus because they aren't paying attention to focus. Might also be suitable in run and gun type situations.",-0.7269

"I think the reason why your camera splits the video files up every 4GB is about the SD Card format as opposed to the camera doing it on it's own. If you format your cards to exFAT, then this should not be a problem. SD cards are usually formated as FAT 32 which has a maximum capacity for single files at 4GB.

I wanted the 14-140 lens as an all rounder, and that is also available for £160!! So add the £15 postage and there you have a kit for a mere £335!! Or if you must have a new one it is £438 with a 14-42 lens after £50 cash back at UK digital! The preowned stuff on ebay has always been great-had several lenses and a camera like that-and all looked like new!!",0.9147
"So I am trying to start a photography business as well as begin making videos. I have a budget of around $1000 (I am 17) and I have a few wants/needs for a camera. These include: Sharp image quality, at least 6 fps shooting, at least 1080p 60fps (slow motion is something I will be doing) but 4k would be much better, at least 20000 iso, wi fi and bluetooth as well as time lapse mode would be nice, tilting display, good auto focus, microphone port (not necessary but it would be nice), a touch screen would be great, Environmental sealing would also be nice, lots of lenses to choose from. So those are my needs/wants in a camera, It will be for everything from landscape photography, to product photography, portraits and the video will be used just as much. I have narrowed my search to 2 camera that I have found and can get for the same price right now. They are the Canon T7i and the Sony a6300. The kits I found have the following: Canon T7i, EF-S 18 - 55mm IS STIM, EF-S 55 - 250mm lens, filter, battery charger, 2 batteries and camera bag or the Sony a6300, 16 - 50mm lens, battery and charger. Both kits cost the same. I am having trouble deciding, I like the T7i for the ease of use i.e. touch screen, fully articulating, lots of lens options, good button layout, classic dslr feel and the 60fps 1080p is the only reason I want to pay more for it over the T6i which is $500 off at the moment as I want to do slow motion. But I am disappointed that it doesn't have 4k which is why the sony a6300 is nice. I like the 4k capabilities and the 1080p 60fps. Really both cameras have similar photography capabilities. But I am disappointed that the sony a6300 doesn't have a touch screen and the numerous articles about sony a6300's over heating are worrisome as well as the poor button layout.  Anyways, my question is which of these 2 packages is the better option for my needs as both are the same price and if you have a better option to recommend please let me know! Thank you very much and I hope to hear some replies soon as the deals are time sensitive. Thanks.",0.9943
