I have also met other 20D owners who remain very pleased with the performance.",0.9516

Yes, it does. All you do is turn the top mode dial into M or manual mode then turn the setting dial until it reaches B or Bulb mode.

"Hello,
I would suggest downloading the instruction manual from Canon's web site (see description of this video for link). If you want the best source of info on this camera I would suggest The Canon 20D Magic Lantern Guide.
