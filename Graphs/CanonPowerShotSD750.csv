"I have been in the market for a new camera. I was looking a several in the $250 ballpark. Then today I was at Goodwill and found this camera, still in the box. All booklets there but the bag they were in was opened. The camera card still in the bag unopened. It looks like someone got the camera, checked out the owners manual, attached the strap then put it back in the box. Going to try out my new (2007) camera tomorrow. Think I 'like be happy with my $25 purchase.",0.9109

Old tech now.  Now the g7x is probably same to what this sold for and has twice the clarity and bigger and better sensor.  Amazing how tech has developed into something we now take for granted as before it was a bigger thing to have a digital camera now we just take it as normal.  I wonder in ten years what we will have and how we will look back at these old reviews and laugh about something that is so far behind compared to what is out now.,0.9325

I just bought this for my pops (his bday). I guess I made a good choice lol...,0.4404
this camera does NOT have image stabilization (IS),0.0
I really wanted this camera first before I got the Sony DSC-W80 and I tell you I compare the picture quality between the two and the sony comes out on top everytime. Maybe because it can take pictures in High Definition. But the canon has a nice screen size and it is slimmer. i might just get this one too.,0.5574

that what I do with uploading on youtube.
let me know if you have more questions",0.4939
I won't buy it now.  I'll wait for their next model which will probably be released on Spring.  How do you guys feel about the battery? That's the only thing that makes me think twice about Canon's digital cameras.,0.0
"I agree!!  I bought a Kodak, but before I opened the box I came home and did some research.  It seems like the SD750 is the ""it camera"" right now.  I found it at Circuit City for $210 which was $40 cheaper than Target.  It's fabulous.  I wish it came with a case, but I ordered one.  I also put one of my PDA screen protectors on that massive and stunning screen. :-)",0.9642
"I got this camera for Christmas, the images are stunning.",0.3818
"The only thing that makes me think twice about it is that it doesn't have image stabilization and the battery is below average while Sony's can last up to almost 400 shots per full battery and pictures are fine.  If Canon cameras came with a battery that lasted THAT LONG and with image stabilization, woulnd't it be nice? :)",0.765
