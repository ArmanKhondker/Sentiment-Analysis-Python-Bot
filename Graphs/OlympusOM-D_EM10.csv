"Hi Mathieu
(I'n now using the NikonD90) I want to buy a smaller camera which can take both good pictures and videos, so after researches I'm in between Canon g7 mark ii, Olympus OM D EM mark ii and Olympus OM D EM 10 (this last one more for the lower price). G7 and Olympus mark ii look similar for some features but different for others.  
Which would you recommend (mostly for portraits and daily use)?
(I don't need 4K, most important is a good price/quality)
THANK YOU",0.9377

"Looking into purchasing this camera, but want to know if I can comfortably use the lens (the M.Zuiko Digital 14-42mm II R) that comes with it instead of needing to purchase another one right away. What lenses were used in this video? What do you recommend? Thank you in advance!",0.9062
"Hi Matthieu, I am trying to buy a small camera, I don’t know which one to buy between Sony a6000 and the Olympus m10 Mark II. I’ll mainly be using it to blog (food and style). Which one do you think gives a better photo quality and better colours? Thank you.",0.8074

"If you were on a budget vs not on a budget, and had to choose 1 lens for landscape/travel photography for this camera which one would be? I was looking at the 25mm 1.8 but I'd like to have the zoom option as well. ( PS: im not impressed by the kit lens sharpness/) thanks",0.752
"Hi Mathieu! Thanks for the awesome video, very complete and informatice! I'm about to buy one of these, but i can choose between two offers, one with the 14-42 II R and the other with the 14-42 EZ pancake like the one you use in the video. What do you think about the EZ quality and power zoom? Especially on the power zoom i have some doubts as i would prefer a manual operated zoom..what's your opinion on that? Thanks and keep it up!!",0.9639

Would it be wise to buy the mark I if it’s my first camera? And will I still be able to take similar long exposures with the mark I as compared with the mark ii? Thanks great video by the way,0.8875
Hi! This is so informative but is this excellent when it comes to street/landscape photography? Thanks!,0.9099
"Interestingly, the On-Off switch is an ancient design, almost identical to the original Olympus OM-.1 (and similar to the OM-2 also). I think it was intended to give the retro look and echo those great film cameras.",0.8442
"Hi, may I know which camera will you suggest omd em 10 ii or omd em 10 iii?",0.0
"Great comparison review- clear illustrations too. Actually the On/Off switch is an ancient design! It's wonderful to see. It is almost identical to the switch on the old Olympus OM1 and OM2 cameras from the 1970s (see links). They moved away from having an on/off switch on the OM3 and OM4 film cameras and had battery leak problems! So I love the On/Off switch! I want an OMD10. Actually I like the screen that doesn't swing out to the left. http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/classics/olympusom1n2/om2/index.htm

just sold my olympus pen epl 6 camera. anyone got any suggestions for camera upgrade? i love the epl 6 but i wonder if i should try fuji or sony? or should just stick with the omd em10? thanks in advance!,0.8064
"Thanks a lot for the video Mathieu. I am relatively new in photography. Considering buying either this M10 Mark ii, Lumix G7 or Sony A6000.
In my opinion, a6000 is getting old. G7 looks nice but very video-focused. M10 Mark ii seems like a good option. What do you think ?",0.8735

Thanks a lot for the review. What do you think better for video Sony a6000 or this Olympus. Thanks again!,0.8398
"First visual impressions on buying one- solid beautiful and very good quality. One small criticism is the grip or lack of. And as it's fairly weighty, i put my finger underneath to compensate and the edge is too sharp. So therefor I will look at a good half case and hope this helps",0.9258

Do you think it makes sense to buy older em5? I am new to photography and dont want to spend so much money on a new camera so I am looking for a second hand one. As the em5 is weather sealed it would be a benefit for me as I will shoot when travelling.,0.5541

very informative video thank you for effort!!",0.573
the problem is that your nose is too long for the camera lol Just kidding....,0.0258
Very good video :),0.7548
"How does it fair against the em5 ii? Especially when it comes to video? Does it have a flat profile like the em5 ii does? And is the body too small, like some people have complained? If it's smaller than say the em5 ii or a panasonic camera then it's going to be a problem for me :/",-0.3527

"Hey
How is the a6000 as compared to the M10 II ?
I'm an advanced amateur considering a holistic camera that could be a nice dslr replacement. 
Does the bigger sensor on the a6000 make that much of a difference? 
Is the lens stabilization enough or should I opt for the M10 II? 
Appreciate the detailed review :)",0.8762

"Mathieu, very good review. Does E-M10 mark II has a problem with continuous trying to re-focusing in video mode, like you can see on this video on second 10 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=555T1FvH7SU (it's made by OM-D EM-5 first gen)
This case isn't so bad, since the object is very static, but usually it's trying to re-focusing more often when it's not needed making the video really useless. The problem is valid with both m.zuiko 60mm f2.8 macro and Panasonic Lumix G 20mm F/1.7 ASPH lenses.",-0.6599

"Salut, j'ai vu un commentaire en fr et à l'accent j'ai un peut reconnu donc j'en profite comme je suis au top en anglais, j'ai actuellement un canon 70d avec un 18-35 de chez sigma et un 50mm, je cherche quelques chose de plus léger et compact quand je part en vacances ou sur des soirées, ce que je veux conservé c'est surtout le RAW, le viseur, la possibilité de changer d'optique et un bon placement au niveau du tarif, j'aimerai aussi un piqué correct, pas digne d'un 5d mark III avec une optique L, mais au moins d'un 70d avec un objo de kit. Je pense que ce olympus rentre parfaitement dans mes critère, peux-tu me confirmé ? As-tu des exemple en haute def de photo prise avec le kit de base de ce olympus ? Merci beaucoup pour ton retour !!

"I think the problem with your sideway shift is that you're recording in 25p. If you're gonna pan a lot, i think it's no brainer to use 60p. I think the same issue often happens in action cam, thats why people opt for action cam that can do 60p because they pan a lot. They also eliminate the jumping sequence because of the pixel binning, which makes it much smoother.",-0.5994

I would be interested in them if they are around the same price point.",0.9581

how does this camera compare to the  original em5?,0.3182

"Just got the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II.  One of the things I noticed is a very noticeable lag/jerk when using the EVF.  I tried a couple of different lenses (the 14-42 kit lens and 45mm prime) and they both do this.  The jerking/lagging goes away when I switch to the Simulated Optical Viewfinder.  I'm wondering if this is an issue with the camera in general that may be fixed with some future firmware update or if its a specific defect that requires exchanging the camera, as the jerk/lag is very annoying when using the EVF.  Did you notice this when you were using the EVF?",-0.659
