"I have been shooting point and shoot for many years and finally decided to move of up to DSLR. I selected the d300 because it looked to be just before Nikon went to video, which I didn't need. I still shoot a manual Nikon fe and so I like the fact that I can use all my old film lenses on this camera. I am very impressed and satisfied by this camera. I saved a substantial amount as well buying a used camera.",0.8909

Give the client the best of what's available.  I had the D300. Dynamic range was not so good compared to film. Also the crop sensor was a drag. This is 2018. Give your clients the best,0.7948

"A few years ago I got a fantastic deal for a d300S, the body had only 10 shutter count, it was basic brand new in a opened box I paid around  400$ and I still love this camera to this day! Of course id love to have the D500 or the  sony A9, but for what I am able to do with the D300S I can not justify the extra expense.",0.7777

"Hi Fonz, I've bought a D300 for a strange half-assed reason & you may think I'm a bit weird.  I want to compare the skin tones look of the D300 images with those of my newer, smaller, lighter very fashionable Fuji X-T1. The Fuji is fantastic in many ways, but somehow I just have this annoying feeling in the back of my mind that the skin tones don't look as satisfying and natural as those from my previous Nikon D700 images.  I'm a cheapskate and can't quite stretch to re-buying the D700 just to test a feeling, but I saw a minty, boxed D300 for £210 - and it was just beautiful and really tempting. I figure the D300 is the little brother to the D700 and will share similar design parameters and components, and (hopefully) overall look to its output: - after all, Nikon wanted it to be really top class for APSC and built it really expensive.  It's also APSC so I can directly compare the look of 12 MP Nikon with 16MP Fuji. I'll get a 35 f1.8g DX and 50 f1.8g and do a comparison with the Fuji with 35mm f2 and 50mm f2. I've never owned the 50mm 1.8  'g' lens but I already know the 35 DX lens on the D700 is superb (with a tiny bit of vignetting.) I'm really interested to see what comes out. If the D300 shots look better to me, I may have to re-buy the enormous and heavy D700 LOL. Tim",0.9315
"When making comparisons with recent higher megapixel systems, my dilemma is determining whether the image quality at 12mp is superior to 24mp or 36mp.

My understanding is the comparatively larger and less densely packed pixels on a 12mp sensor result in less noisy image output, but I think dynamic range may improve with higher megapixel systems. 

As higher pixel density sensors are developed I presume the digital signal processing hardware and software keeps pace and perhaps eliminates the noise issues.",0.8379

D300 or the D90? Which one to buy",0.4019
"I have been using a D300 for years as it is all I can afford. I do get great images. yes I would like to upgrade to a D500. But since I can't afford it, that won't be happening. It does a great job. Yes the ISO is lacking for later evening bird photography. I need to stop before others do. And at times it won't autofocus on something I am pretty sure a new camera would. But overall it is a great camera.",0.9735
"Nice to see some D300 disciples on here... still love mine, still chugging along flawlessly... and I do a sports shoot pretty much every weekend (triathlons/cycling/fell-running etc).
Aside from the obvious- prob' the best feature over lower end cameras is the AF fine tune- I couldn't live without it- regularly shooting in poor light/wide open- so AF accuracy is more critical...",0.8591
What a great camera with 100% viewfinder! Same sensor as D5000 and D90 am I right? Kari from Finland .. Ayy,0.6588

In January 2014 I replaced my D300 with the D7100. The D300 sat in an extra camera bag until Dec 2015 when I had it infrared converted. From 2008-Jan 2014 I shot thousands of images with it and really enjoyed it. It's one hell of a camera!,-0.318

"You did a very nice job on this video. I purchased my D300 through E-Bay about 7 months ago to compliment my 2 D3300's that I have. My question is it appears you aren't using your D300 anymore. What camera are you using now? I've been thinking in getting rid of my D3300 and going with a new D7100 because of the $500 instant rebate putting the cost at $688 which isn't bad for a new camera. Or do you have any thoughts on a older model of camera that would be a better buy? Best wishes, Duane",0.9524
I think I'm going to buy this camera as wildlife camera...it's great to know that is still great body!,0.8588
"Hi there, wanted to say nice video.  I just picked up a D300 on ebay, just like you said, $240-$300 - before seeing this video, though.  I agree with you.  I'm not a photog, but appreciate a good camera.  Coming up from a d40 to d300 was quite a change, but thankfully prices allowed me to pick this up.  So, appreciated your video .",0.9366

"I picked up a used D300 this past July for $175.00 as a second body to shoot events along with my D7200. I keep my 50mm 1.8 on it all day long or even my 17-50mm 2.8. D300 has internal focus motor, so old Nikon lenses work on it along with my D7200. Couldn't be happier with the D300. Even picked up a third party battery grip, which increases the fps and makes it easier to shoot in vertical orientation. Very heavy camera, but clearly a tank when it comes to durability and weather sealing. I know this is a camera body I will keep for years. Thanks for your expertise.",0.7822

My D60 broke six months ago and I replaced it with a used D300 (paid $200.00).  I am very happy and I may purchase a Used 700 (for full frame).  I see no reason to spend $2000 for a D500 (I'd rather spend the money on lenses).,-0.0018

"I've only been shooting for just shy of 2 years but in that time I've went from d3200 through d7000 and now have a d7200, d700 and d300, I wont part with the d300 or 700 firstly because they're so inexpensive but also I find their images so pleasing to the eye. In fact I'm going to buy another 300 and 700 for the closet as spares, two cameras that are far too good to be pushed aside by new technology.",0.886

"+Photofonz  ...Way to Go Photofonz, Nice Video!  I've still got mine too. It's actually worth way too much to me, to sell it so cheap on eBay, so I use it when I don't want to carry the D810 or D7200 (Marches, Protests, etc.). Also, I keep thinking of the $1795 that I paid for it, and it's still in Great condition. When the right opportunity comes, I'll probably give it to someone just starting out, someone who will appreciate it's image quality.  ...Hey, it's good to see you making videos again, thanks!",0.9556

"great video,  I got mt D300 about 2 years ago with a battery pack for $600.00, the camera only has about 10.000 shutter activation's, so it's like new. i have used it some but bought the D750 not too long after that, so it has been in the closet. you make me want to start using it again. thanks,  Ive had a gem all this time for sure.",0.8931
"Bless you for this vid, so true, i have a D200, my first ""serious "" camera....i call her Trudie...lol, i upgraded to a Sony a6000, great camera....but do you know what, i still go back to Trudie, i am a manual focuser.....she never lets me down, image quality is superb. I will hunt down a D300, the build and specs on these camera's are awesome.",0.9608
D200 wasn't bad either and you can buy one for next to thing.  However I am seeing D7000s go for $350 used and D300 about the same.  As I see it the trade off would be the amazing Sony sensor in the D7000 for the pro body.,0.7684

I really like your videos thank you for sharing your expertise,0.796
You asked me to check this video out after I commented on your Do You Really Need Full Frame video. Okay this video is just plain awesome. I wish more people went back and reviewed products that are older but could still have a place somewhere. I have a D500 but I still like to use my D300 a lot. It's always like an old familiar friend since I've carried it for 9 years. BTW your photos are awesome.,0.9694
