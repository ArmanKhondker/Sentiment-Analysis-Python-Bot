I have a question.
I'm falling in love with the idea of making birding photography here in Mexico city and I haven't  had a decent camera in about a decade. If I was to buy  a DSLR, I would definitelly get the Canon SL2,  with a telephoto (I love the cutenes of its size and it's tons of features), but that is out of my budget.
Now within the superzoom cameras I was considering to just get a Kodak AZ 421 because it's 42x optical zoom and price. But, have you had any experiences with that Kodak? I know you are not into wildlife photography (maybe) , but maybe you know or any of your friends might know if being that much cheaper, the Kodak performs good for the task. Any ideas?",0.9419

The 80D is perfect for my needs and I am really happy with it. But the rode videomic go picks up awful interference from cell phones/computers/routers. It ruins footage with terrible audio. The only help anyone has given has been to ""turn off your router and phone"". Which is not possible when I am online working and also recording video.

"Sounds like a pretty good camera. One thing it will lack as a DSLR is the capability of being used for streaming via a capture card. Also you kinda always make it sound like mirror-less is worse than DSLR. This is absolutely not the case. In my case, I'm looking at the Sony a5100 as a second camera for video and streaming as it has a clean image setting for HDMI out. Granted, I'm already invested in the Sony ecosystem, but DSLR cannot be used for streaming because of the mirror that won't stay up for a few hours.

But as I said it seems like a pretty good camera and one clever thing about stating out with it is, you can actually adapbt cannon(or any SLR) lenses to mirrorless, so if you chose to go for a mirror-less later, you will at least have your old canon glass to use to begin with :o)",0.977

"I think I've found my first dslr camera! I saw this in store at a local BestBuy and was amazed how petite it was while still having a nice deep dslr handle grip and feel. The store dealers obviously wanted to persuade me to go up the line to the T7i and even the EOS 70D (because sell higher = meeting quota quicker), but even still I was very magnetized to the SL2 and felt it would be perfect for where I am in photography. As mentioned in this video, it has the dslr fitment which means I can invest into dslr lenses (which is the important long term factor anyways) and because it is so small, when I decide to get into street photography, this will be much less intimidating than say a Nikon D750 or worse, a Canon 1D lol.",0.7705

I've already watched your other video about lenses, where you were recommending the 24mm as the YouTube lens, but in almost all your videos, in the description it says you're using the 10-18 mm one. So I'm not sure which one to go for?  Would the 24mm one work with the Ring Light, considering the ring light needs to be close to you, but the 24mm lens it's more ""zoomed"" in than the 10-18mm one, in order to achieve a similar shoot like yours, capturing half way up of the body?

I had none and that has never been an issue for me! Wanna track high speed objects? Use the center one and keep you subject on focus!

It has a Canon 10x Optical Zoom HD Video Lens, Canon HD CMOS pro image sensor, Canon Digic DV III image processor, Optical Image Stabilizer and a 3.5"" swing out (selfie mode) touch screen. I usually shoot at 24P in FXP mode, it will also shoot 60i, PF24, or PF30 in MXP, XP+, SP, or LP mode. It is capable of full 1080p. It has an input for an external mic, and an ""S"" Mini Advanced Shoe (which I don't know what would fit on there).

Battles won by Canon SL2 - Dual Pixel Auto focus, lens selection, little bit more affordable, full size sensor
Battles won by Panasonic G85 - IBIS, 4k (more future proof?)

Interesting because they're both probably close in size, and price really. Auto focus is hard to give up...so if you went with this Canon you could make up some of the image stabilization you sacrifice from the G85 depending on what lens you bought or gimble. And since the Canon's probably about $150-200 cheaper than the G85, if you bought the body only maybe for the same price that stabilized lens could get you a pretty good package. I for a long time had decided that the G85 probably was going to be what I replace my Canon Vixia HF600 with, but now this has got me thinking this might be the better vessel.",0.8658
"Sean, I feel like this video was created just for me!!!! I can't believe it!!  I am travelling to New York (from Scotland) in December for my best friends Bachelorette. And, as my gift to her I am going to vlog the whole trip. I have NEVER done anything like this before and I was literally about to purchase a G7x mark ii next week. But, the price was going to kill me. This is definitely a better option for me I think - specifically, the walk-through feature it has for beginners - and I cannot thank you enough. Honestly, it's as if you knew!! Do you have any advice or could you do a video on what you would need to start up: for example what memory cards I would need and how much memory to capture 5 days of footage. Once again THANK YOU!!!

Based on your reviews and weeks of research, I'm certainly going with the SL2 over the M3 (not ready to give up the EVF just yet). One point worth mentioning, is that although the 9 AF points seems limited, once in live-view you've got the entire screen to play with; so infinitely more AF points.
